Hello everyone, this is the official guide ~~(is it necessary to be so formal since the game only have one creator)~~. Here are some guidence for the story mode to facilitate players experiencing the entire game. For example, you can switched the language to Chinese on the setting of main menu.

At the beginning, there is nothing to say. After getting the right direction, just hold down the joystick, and it will automatically attack once the weapon cools down. However, it should be mentioned that if you are defeated by the enemy in the guided section, after a hidden dialogue you will skip the guided section and move on to the next section.

From the beginning of the battle of graffiti section, you are provided three choices - square: balanced, beginner friendly; triangle: range attack with a high upper limit; hexagonal: defense counterattack with a guaranteed lower limit. After you choose one, the enemy randomly selects a geometry to fight against you. At this time, the enemy's health is only 80% of yours ~~(the author's mercy)~~, and the attack mode is also very single (only fixed towards your direction). Therefore, the general strategy is to move in circles. And in the boss battle of the graffiti section, the boss can summon four types of miscellaneous enemys and use three spells with strong/weak tracking. It is recommended to use the kite tactics and get familar with each enemy/spell though practice ~~(what an irresponsible guidence)~~. If you're not familiar yet, don't panic. You can adjust the difficulty in the settings interface.

After the animation transitions, we enter the fantasy section, and the overall game becomes 3D. To facilitate operation, there is also a camera switch button in the upper part of the screen for switching the camera's overview/following perspective. On the floating island of day scene, the player's main/secondary weapons are fireballs (straight line attack) and continuous flames (strafing attack). For enemies who only use a single fireball as a weapon, the quick pass strategy is to attract it to different levels. After knocking down by a fireball and then strafing. In the ghost suburb of night scene, the player's main/secondary weapons are tracking bullets (weak tracking), fin funnels (especially useful), and the enemy's weapon is still the fireball. At this time, they have to constantly climb up and down the ladder to fight and dodge (be careful not to fall out, and it has been tested that in normal difficulty you even don't need the direction joystick). After completing the level, the main story ends.

Then we have to mention the game controller in the settings interface (which seems to be treated as a decoration), but it actually an invincibility Easter egg left behind (why hasn't anyone tried the Konami cheat code?). Up, down, left, right, left, right, B and A. Due to the icons on the phone are too small, the rule has changed to pressing the directional keys eight times and the function keys twice (there will be a "ding" from the flingtrainer when successful, and a page turning sound when failed to indicate that it has been reset). The first time you open it, there will be a conversation reminder that you can switch it on and off. This can be considered as an official cheat way.

Finally, let me post the ending image for the story mode. After completing the challenge mode, there will be another image and a new fingerstyle guitar. Just discover them in the game!

中文攻略：

ᅟᅠᅟᅠ大家好，这里是游戏官方(话说就制作者一人有必要这么正式吗)。在此更新下剧情模式的攻略以方便玩家体验整个游戏。游戏默认英文，但中文可以直接在主菜单的设置页面进行更改。

ᅟᅠᅟᅠ最开始的引导部分自然不用多说，攻击对好方向后按住摇杆就行，CD转好即会自动攻击。不过需要提一句的是如果你被引导关的敌方击败则会进入隐藏对话，然后同样结束引导部分进入下一部分。    

ᅟᅠᅟᅠ涂鸦部分从对战开始就给了三个几何体的选择：正方各项均衡，新手友好，三角范围攻击，上限很高，六边防守反击，保证下限。在你选择后敌方随机选择一个几何图形与你对战，这时敌方血量只有你的八成（来自作者的怜悯），攻击模式也很单一（只会固定朝着你的方向攻击），所以大概策略就是绕圈消耗，较为容易就能过。涂鸦部分的Boss战中Boss可以召唤四种杂兵和使用三种带强/弱跟踪的法术，建议是风筝以及发扬魂系精神多死几次就熟了(好不负责任的攻略)。还没熟的话也不用慌，在设置界面还能进一步调整难度。

ᅟᅠᅟᅠ接着动画过场后就进入了异想部分，整体游戏变为3D，为方便操作屏幕中上部分还放了个相机切换的按钮便于切换相机的总览/跟随视角。在场景一的空岛中，玩家的主/副武器分别是火球(直线攻击)，连发火焰(扫射攻击)，对于只有单火球作为武器的敌方速通策略是骗到不同层，一个火球击倒后接一通扫射，直接就能清空七八成血条。而在场景二的鬼郊中，玩家的主/副武器分别为跟踪弹(弱跟踪)，浮游炮(特别好用)，敌方还是单火球，这时就要不断上下梯打拉扯了(小心坠亡，以及实测普通难度扣掉方向键也能过)。通关后主线部分就此结束。

ᅟᅠᅟᅠ然后就得提及设置界面的这个游戏手柄了(好像都把它当成了装饰)，其实是留的一处无敌彩蛋(为什么没有人试试科乐美秘籍呢)。上上下下左右左右BA，这里由于手机上图标太小，魔改成了按方向键位八次，功能键位两次(成功时会有月影宗的“叮”，失败时会有翻页声代表已经重置)。首次开启会有对话提醒此处可以开关无敌，算是官方作弊码了

ᅟᅠᅟᅠ最后贴张通关剧情模式的尾插吧，通关挑战模式后还会有另一张插和新的吉他指弹，就敬请各位在游戏中发现了
