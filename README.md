# Paper-Fantasy (纸间异想)

I personally believe that game is the ninth art, with the goal of creating works that can touch people's hearts. On the occasion of graduation, I chose to make an indie games as my graduation project.

In middle school, I used to play various games with my classmates in the information class computer room. There was a period of time, I was attracted to a flash game Silver Cavalry recommended by one of my roommate. At that time, I made up my mind to create a shoot game myself after I had the ability. Now that I finally have the corresponding ability and enough time, So I directly choose shoot as the type of game to start fulfilling my childhood dreams (but limited by the art assets, the final product is closer to Archers.io and Fanta Shooting).

And recalling the primary/middle school life when players and creators co creating face-to-face though chatting and drawing. Constructing games on notebooks, creating maps, recording data... Of course and the most important thing - take care not to be catched by teachers. Unfortunately, the current hardware is far ahead, but there is not enough free time and friends. Perhaps out of nostalgia, I have set the visual style as graffiti and added some co creation elements during the guidance, hoping to recreate some of the scenes from that time to commemorate.

中文简介：

​    个人相信游戏是第九艺术，以做出能打动人心的作品为目标，值此毕业之际便选择单人开发独立游戏作为毕业设计。

​    之前初中时经常和同学在信息课机房打各种游戏，有一阵被室友推荐的flash页游纯白枪骑兵吸引，当时就立下宏愿有能力后自己做个射击对战游戏。现在终于算是有相应的能力以及足够的时间，就直接将玩法类型选定为射击对战开始圆梦童年(虽然但是，受限于机体素材相关成品更接近于弓箭手大作战和奇幻射击)。

​    再回忆之前那个在笔记本上写写画画架构游戏的时期，玩家与创作者面对面讨论共创，实时绘制地图，记录数据……当然还有传统艺能提防老师。可惜现在的硬件遥遥领先与当时，身边却少了足够的空闲时间和游戏的最高配制——朋友。或许是出于怀念，本人将画面风格定为纸上涂鸦，并在引导时加入了些许共创元素，希望能再现部分当时情景聊以纪念。
