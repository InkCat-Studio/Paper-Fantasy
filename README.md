&emsp;&emsp;I personally believe that game is the ninth art, with the goal of creating works that can touch people's hearts. On the occasion of graduation, I chose to make an indie games as my graduation project.

&emsp;&emsp;In middle school, I used to play various games with my classmates in the information class computer room. There was a period of time, I was attracted to a flash game Silver Cavalry recommended by one of my roommate. At that time, I made up my mind to create a shoot game myself after I had the ability. Now that I finally have the corresponding ability and enough time, So I directly choose shoot as the type of game to start fulfilling my childhood dreams (but limited by the art assets, the final product is closer to Archers.io and Fanta Shooting).

&emsp;&emsp;And recalling the primary/middle school life when players and creators co creating face-to-face though chatting and drawing. Constructing games on notebooks, creating maps, recording data... Of course and the most important thing - take care not to be catched by teachers. Unfortunately, the current hardware is far ahead, but there is not enough free time and friends. Perhaps out of nostalgia, I have set the visual style as graffiti and added some co creation elements during the guidance, hoping to recreate some of the scenes from that time to commemorate.
